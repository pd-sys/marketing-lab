# NPBH Marketing Lab 🥒

A living research project to find, test, and document AI-powered marketing tools and automation systems — starting with **The Picklr Japan**, then rolling out across the full NPBH portfolio.

---

## The Goal

We're building a marketing engine that can run at scale without scaling headcount.

**Phase 1 — Picklr Japan:**
Figure out which tools and automations actually work for our specific situation: Japanese market, new brand, pre-launch, small team.

**Phase 2 — NPBH Platform:**
Package the best-performing systems as reusable playbooks for Mino Pickleball, Paddle Up, Pickle Tokyo, and any future brands.

The bet: a small team with the right automation stack can out-market a larger team operating manually.

---

## How This Works

Each issue in this repo represents one resource — a tool, framework, or tactic — that came from research across founders, growth marketers, and AI builders.

**Issue lifecycle:**
1. `status: to-experiment` → queued, not yet tested
2. `status: in-progress` → someone is actively experimenting
3. `status: documented` → tested, results written up, decision made (adopt / adapt / skip)

When you pick something up, assign the issue to yourself and move it to `in-progress`. When done, write up what you learned in the issue comments and close with a verdict.

## What "Documented" Looks Like

When an experiment is done, the issue should include:

- **What we tested** — exactly what we built or tried
- **Result** — what worked, what didn't, numbers if available
- **Verdict** — Adopt / Adapt / Skip
- **Reusable output** — prompt, script, skill, or playbook (if adopt/adapt)
- **NPBH applicability** — which other brands could use this and how

The goal is a library of proven playbooks, not a graveyard of bookmarks.

## Quick Wins (Start Here)

If you're not sure where to start, these are lowest effort / highest potential return:

1. **[#7 Humanizer Skill](../../issues/7)** — 5 min install, should be on everything we publish
2. **[#9 Entity Stack](../../issues/9)** — 1 week of profile building, no technical skills needed
3. **[#10 GSC Internal Linking](../../issues/10)** — 30 minutes, measurable ranking lift
4. **[#12 Competitor Comparison Pages](../../issues/12)** — skill already installed, just needs content input
5. **[#6 TikTok/Reels System](../../issues/6)** — core organic growth engine for Pickle Tokyo

---

## Target Brands (Phase 2 Expansion)

Once a system is proven on Picklr Japan, it gets documented and rolled out:

| Brand | Focus Area |
|-------|-----------|
| **The Picklr Japan** | Primary test bed — membership pre-sales, facility launch |
| **Mino Pickleball** | E-commerce, product ads, brand building |
| **Paddle Up** | Retail, product comparison pages, local SEO |
